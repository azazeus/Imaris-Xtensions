# Imaris-Xtensions
Custom MATLAB extensions to Imaris functionality for Lakdawala Lab

This is very much a work in progress. The purpose of these scripts is to either extend the built-in functionality of Imaris image analysis algorithms or use data generated by Imaris analysis to perform further processing or analyzing statistics.

More information about the scripts is found in the opening comments of the respective .m files.
